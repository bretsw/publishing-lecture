# Writing

```{r, out.width = "720px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/publish.jpg")
```

---

# Understanding writing

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/thread.jpg")
```

- Start with **Problem** (what's missing) + **Purpose** (so what?)

--

- Jump to **Research Questions**

--

- Back to **Lit Review (what is known)** + **Framework** (what to look at)

--

- Forward to **Method** (how to answer RQs)

--

- Forward to **Results** (what was found) + **Discussion** (how it fits the literature)

# Publishing

```{r, out.width = "720px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/publish.jpg")
```

---

# Understanding publishing

```{r, out.width = "480px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/publish.jpg")
```

--

- Philosophy and principles of **open science**: knowledge for the common good

--

- **Apprenticeship** in a community of practice

--

  - Legitimate peripheral participation
  
--

  - Situated learning

---

# Picking a journal

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/cocktail-party.jpg")
```

--

- Join the cocktail party conversation (thanks Ralph!)

--

-  Try to cite 5 articles from the journal

---

# Reaching out

```{r, out.width = "600px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/reach-out.jpg")
```

--

- Remember that editors are people too

--

- Seriously

--

- All the ones I know are really great people on top of that

---

# Waiting

```{r, out.width = "720px", echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("img/across-time.jpg")
```

--

- No getting around it, waiting is hard. 

--

- It  also seems to be a major task in academia.

--

- Do your part early and well, then find something else to keep you busy while you wait
